# ATOA
Adaptive Trajectory Learning with Obstacle Awareness (ATOA) is a framework for motion planning.
ATOA allows the network to adaptively predict intermediate states, with the potential for more efficient planning solutions. 
This repository:
1. Contains the file `train.py` used for training ATOA.  
2. Contains the file `test.py` used for testing ATOA.  
3. Contains the remaining Python files used in conjunction with `train.py` and `test.py`.  
4. Will soon include dataset files for training.
